The Fairness Metrics Ontology (FMO) is intended as a knowledge resource to define fairness metrics, describe their use cases, and detail the relationships between them. It additionally includes concepts related to machine learning models, enabling the representation of specific fairness information within a RDF knowledge graph.

For more information, see [An Ontology for Fairness Metrics](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3514094.3534137), our  AIES '22 conference paper, or [its accompanying poster](https://homepages.rpi.edu/~frankj6/aies22.html). For a short paper to give a quick introduction, see [our US2TS abstract](https://homepages.rpi.edu/~frankj6/US2TS-2022-Towards_an_Ontology_for_Fairness_Metrics.pdf).
