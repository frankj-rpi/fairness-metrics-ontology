# Fairness Metrics Ontology for Clustering

The Fairness Metrics Ontology for Clustering (FMO-Clust) is an OWL2 ontology for the standardized representation of fairness metrics, fairness notions, and related machine learning concepts (including bias mitigation algorithms, machine learning models, and statistical metrics) for the clustering domain. Its primary goal is to guide AI/ML developers in the measurement and interpretation of clustering model fairness, as well as to aid ML fairness researchers by cataloguing emerging concepts in the fast-evolving field fair clustering research in a standardized and provenance-aware way. FMO-Clust has been designed from the ground up to fully support semantic technologies, including reasoning based on OWL2 restrictions, question-answering through description logic or SPARQL queries, and the instantiation of classes as individuals in an RDF knowledge graph to represent user-specific data.

FMO-Clust is the newest addition to the fairness metrics ontology family: the other two ontologies are the fairness ontology for classification (FMO-Class or FMO-C) and the fairness ontology for regression (FMO-Reg or FMO-R), and one for clustering (FMO-Clust). FMO-Clust was released on April 18th, 2024. For more information, see [Version History](https://github.com/frankj-rpi/fairness-metrics-ontology/blob/main/README.md#version-history).
